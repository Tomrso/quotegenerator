This is a project for the Front End Development Libraraies certificate on FreeCodeCamp.
I took inspiration from the example and added my own style. I enjoyed building this with React and got to play with some simple CSS transitions, state and event hooks.
Quotes are randomly selected from the 'Quoteable' API found here: https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable
Hope this can bring some joy to someone when they need an inspirational quote.
As always, please let me know where I can improve in my React code!
